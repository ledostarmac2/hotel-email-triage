# Handoff Log

## 2026-05-16

Summary:

- Set up the multi-agent handoff documentation framework.
- Documented the active ReplyRight architecture, current state, risks, and decisions.
- Preserved the distinction between the active Python/FastAPI app and the older Next.js scaffold.
- Kept the app read-only for Outlook.
- Made two portability/build hygiene edits: removed obsolete `pywebview` vendoring from `build_exe.ps1`, and changed the Outlook macro export path to the current user's Documents folder instead of a workstation-specific repo path.

Files changed:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `docs/HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`
- `.codex/config.toml`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `build_exe.ps1`
- `outlook_dashboard/static/outlook_refresh_macro.bas`

Verification:

- Repository inspection completed.
- `python -m unittest tests.test_ai_and_database` passed.
- Full commit/push status should be recorded in the final assistant response for this work.

Remaining work:

- Rebuild and launch-test `dist\ReplyRight.exe` after these source edits.
- Confirm the latest VBA macro works in classic Outlook on both work and home machines.
- Confirm OpenAI key/model behavior once credentials are available.
